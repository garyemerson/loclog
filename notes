TODO
----
* fix layout of buttons, perhaps replace with 3d touch button and dropdown
    * maybe when using dropdown as options are selected the view eagerly changes in the background
* instead of list of json show list of location names similar to how the frequent locations page in Settings displays
* for logs show only minute markers and make side swipe to reveal full datetime like in messages app
* allow a map preview of locations/visits that have been saved
